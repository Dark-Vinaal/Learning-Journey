## 🤖 Module 06: Robotics & Physical AI

Robotics is where AI gains a **Physical Embodiment**. We are currently in the era of **Physical AI**, where robots learn through experience rather than rigid programming.

### 1. The Humanoid Revolution

2025 marks the transition of humanoid robots (like **Tesla Optimus** or **Figure AI**) from labs to actual warehouses and factories.

* **General-Purpose Robots:** Unlike traditional robotic arms, humanoids are designed to use human tools and navigate human spaces.
* **End-to-End Learning:** Robots are now trained using **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**—they learn to walk or grasp objects through millions of "trial and error" simulations in virtual environments before entering the real world.



### 2. Agentic Robotics

Robots are no longer just "following code." They are now **Agents** that can perceive an obstacle, reason a way around it, and communicate their intent to humans using integrated LLMs.
