# 🧠 Introduction to DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)

## 📌 What is `DSA`?
**DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)** is the combination of:
- **Data Structures** → Ways of organizing and storing data.
- **Algorithms** → Step-by-step procedures to solve problems efficiently.

> So, DSA is an efficient way to store and organize data in a step by step process.

Together, DSA helps you write programs that are :
- Fast  
- Optimized  
- Scalable  
- Easy to maintain

## 🗂️ What are Data Structures?
- Data Structures = Ways to store data efficiently.

### Examples:
- **Array**
- **Linked List**
- **Stack**
- **Queue**
- **Tree**
- **Graph**
- **Hash Table**

### Example (Array)
```python
arr = [10, 20, 30]
```

---

## ⚙️ What are Algorithms?
- Algorithms = Step-by-step methods to solve a problem.

### Examples:

- Searching
- Sorting
- Recursion
- Graph traversal (DFS, BFS)

### Example (Simple algorithm)
```python
def find_max(arr):
    max_val = arr[0]
    for x in arr:
        if x > max_val:
            max_val = x
    return max_val
```

## ❓ Why is DSA Used?

| Purpose                    | Explanation                                    |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Optimization**           | Makes your code faster and use less memory     |
| **Scalability**            | Handles large amounts of data efficiently      |
| **Better Problem Solving** | Teaches logical thinking                       |
| **Interviews**             | Every major company asks DSA questions         |
| **Foundation of CS**       | Used everywhere (OS, DBMS, networks, AI, etc.) |

##💻 Small Code Example: Stack
```python
stack = []

stack.append(10)     # push
stack.append(20)
print(stack.pop())   # pop → 20
```
